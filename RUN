 PRECC 2.51 COMPILER COMPILER   Copyright Peter T. Breuer,      Jan 1999

------------------------------------------------------------------------

You should read this file after you have carried out the installation
procedure detailed in INSTALL, or after the automatic installation
mediated by install.exe has completed (DOS) or after `make' has been run
succesfully (UNIX).


RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS.

a) run precc over your script file to produce a C file

	preccx  foobar.y  foobar.c

b) compile the C file, using the  appropriate PRECCX  library as final
   resource. For example, under UNIX, using the libcc.a library in the
   current directory:

   gcc -o foobar foobar.c -L . -lcc  -D__STDC__
 
   The flag __STDC__ can be defined, but most ansi compilers do this for
   you.  You DON'T need to set __STDC__ if compiling under TURBO-C, for
   instance, because either the compiler will be in ansi mode and set it
   for you, or it will be in TC mode, which is a superset, and the flag
   will not be set and it does not matter.  All you have to check for is
   that the compiler not be in K&R mode, because that is a subset of
   ansi and PRECCX uses ansi prototypes that are not K&R compatible.
   
   The compilation instructions under TURBO-C are

   tc foobar.c /b
   
   and you should have prepared a project file in the same directory

		foobar.prj

   which lists foobar.c as its main file, has the directory where you
   put the cc.h and ccx.h files in its list of `include' directories, &
   refers specifically to one of the library files preccx??.lib in the
   file list.  MAKE SURE THAT THE LIBRARY MATCHES THE MEMORY MODEL AND
   TOKEN SIZE!!  For example, use preccx1c.lib for `char' TOKENs and the
   `compact' model.

c) run the executable that results, typing into it to test it out:

	foobar

Examples of the usual forms of PRECCX script are in the  directory that
the installation routine by default assigns to \PRECCX\EXAMPLE, and the
source for these is the preccxe.zip archive in the distribution.
