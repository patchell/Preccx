INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR DOS AND UNIX.

The DOS install.exe routine should have put the  components of the dist-
ribution in place, or at least where you told it to put them!

For UNIX, either

i) in this directory run  make config; make; make test; make install, or

ii) change to a different build directory. I suggest ./build/<whatever>
     mkdir -p build/<whatever>; cd build/<whatever>
   Then the Makefile needs to be created in that directory by running
     ../src/configure --srcdir=<whatever the absolute path of ./src is>
   After that and still in the build directory, you run
     make;  make install

The latter was what (i) would do, after inventing a name corresponding
to your system architecture for the build directory.  You can also build
in the src directory itself by just typing "./configure; make; make
install".

In case you want to modify the system target directories for the final
instalation, you can either run configure with various options (try
configure --help to see them all), or you can, instead of make install,
go into the build directory and place the following files manually:

a) Put the following files where your C compiler will find them:
 
              - HEADERS  (in PRECCXI.ZIP or PRECCX\INCLUDE)
cc.h		/* precc header file (no inherited attributes)  */
ccx.h		/* precc header file (for inherited attributes) */
p_config.h      /* compilation switches for your system         */
      
	      - LIBRARY  (in PRECCXL.ZIP or PRECCX\LIB)
libcc1.a   (UNIX)
libcc2.a   (UNIX)  [optional]
libcc4.a   (UNIX)  [optional]
preccx1C.lib (DOS)
preccx2C.lib (DOS) [optional]
preccx4C.lib (DOS) [optional]
preccx1L.lib (DOS)
preccx2L.lib (DOS) [optional]
preccx4L.lib (DOS) [optional]

I can't really help you with the placing because it will be specific to
your installation and your compiler.  But I have the headers in
\home\include, and the libraries in \home\c\lib (under DOS).  Under
UNIX, they are in my $HOME/include and $HOME/c/lib directories
for personal use, and in /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib
for systemwide distribution.

b) link or copy one of the libraries to 

libcc.a   (UNIX)
preccx.lib (DOS)

You  should  choose libcc1.a/preccx1C.lib if you are going to use 1-byte
TOKENs (this is normal)  and the Compact memory model for C, and another
accordingly if you have larger size tokens or the Large model in mind.

c) Make pointers to the binary:

              - EXECUTABLES (in PRECCXX.ZIP or PRECCX\BIN)

preccx[.exe]    /* the precc executable                         */

Put  this  somewhere where your operating system will find it.  That has
to be in a directory named in your PATH variable.  Or make a  PRECCX.BAT
file (DOS) or executable shell script (UNIX) containing the single line

    preccx %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9            (DOS)
    preccx $*                                    (UNIX)

replacing  `preccx'  with  the  exact location of the binary executable.
The BAT/shell file should then be placed somewhere in the PATH  instead.
I have a BAT file in \bin\bat and a shell script in $HOME/bin.

d) Read the literature:
              - MANUALS (in PRECCXD.ZIP or PRECCX\MAN)

   preccx.1   (UNIX: use nroff -man preccx.1 | more)
   preccx.m   (DOS: use more <preccx.m)
   README.EXE (DOS only)

Also  provided is a long technical paper in ascii and .DVI format.  This
should be viewable using dviscr,  dvivga or other publicly available dvi
previewers.

   preccx.t    (DOS: use more <preccx.t,    UNIX: more preccx.t)
   preccx.dvi  (DOS: use dviscr preccx.dvi, UNIX: dvitool preccx or equiv.)

YOU ARE READY TO GO. NOW READ THE FILE "RUN" IN THIS DIRECTORY.
