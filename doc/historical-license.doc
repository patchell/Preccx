    A PREttier Compiler Compiler (eXtended)


Site Licenses.    

If you possess a
          BETA test version of PRECCX or a
          COMMERCIALLY CONTRACTED copy of the PUBLIC distribution
then you MUST sign and return a duplicate of this License or else your
right to it may be not be recognized in law. You will receive a signed
copy in return.

If you possess a
          DEMO version or the
          PUBLIC distribution of PRECCX
then you do not have to worry about protecting yourself, but you should
read and check your rights and obligations. In particular, you should
check if you are one of those groups that is required to hold a
commercial licence.  It is probably anyway in your interest to sign and
return a copy of this Licence, and if you do so, you will always receive
a signed affirmation of your right to hold a copy of the PRECCX code in
return.

Let me be clear about this: I am in favour of free source code and
licenced maintenance and service contracts.  This license attempts to
make source code available to you under most circumstances but also
tries to protect such rights as I derive from authorship of it and the
rights of others to access it.  I am also required to tell you to
protect yourself from your authorities or other interested parties by
registering.  That will cost you NOTHING if you do not wish to obtain
services in return.

The forms of this license that cost money bind me to provide certain
services in support of the software.  By agreeing to be so contracted
the use of this software by commercial organisations is, apparently,
facilitated. If you are not interested in paying money and receiving
such services, disregard this paragraph.

That out of the way, I should say that the intended effect of my putting
these notices in the package is to bind you straight away to observe
certain conditions in its use, somewhat along "copyleft" lines, as set
out below.  Approximately, organisations are generally prohibited from
distributing this software without my consent, but individuals may pass
on small numbers of complete packages without permission provided they
do not charge and that they ensure the recipient receives these terms
and conditions.  In particular, I give my consent to the distribution of
this package as a complete entity from ftp sites or on recordable media
as part of a public collection of utilities, but no fee should be
charged for the package in itself.  (Fees for distribution of or access
to the collection as a whole may be charged and that is fine by me).
When the package reaches a corporation or government agency, however,
and it is distributed within or by that organisation, then a special
license arrangement must be sought along the following lines:

Corporate and Governmental Site License

This license is not necessary for the DEMO version of the software.  You
can tell if you have a DEMO version because it has a full page sign-on
screen that identifies itself as such, and a limit on line length and
file length.

This is a license for use of a BETA release or COMMERCIALLY CONTRACTED
copy of the PUBLIC distribution of the PRECCX software within your
company or government agency, and is not transferable.  This allows
internal use of the software at one site per copy in your network, or as
many sites as may be otherwise contracted for (see "register.doc" in the
PRECCX documentation archive or subdirectory for Site License price
schedule).  Distributing, repackaging, or reselling of the software to
third parties without the agreement of the licensor is otherwise not
allowed, although new software generated by or with the utility may be
distributed internally or externally without any restriction.  All Site
Licenses are prepaid at the stipulated rates.

Non-commercial Licence

If you are a single individual not about to engage in distribution of
the PRECCX software for profit, you will want to know about the
following terms.

This license permits you the possession and use of any unrestricted
version of the software, including a BETA test version.  Distributing,
repackaging, or reselling of the software to third parties is not
allowed without the agreement of the licensor, with the following
exception: you may distribute the entire package as a complete unit
provided that you do not charge either for the package or your
distribution of it, and you bind recipients to observe the conditions
set out in this document.  All licenses are prepaid (but the cost for a
BETA version is nil).


When licences are contracted for and granted, they look like this:
