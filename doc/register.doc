REGISTRATION: see license.doc. For individual use you do not need any licensing
beyond that given in license.doc. But commercial and government organizations
must register and obtain agreement in order to distribute PRECCX within or by
their organization (I would think you  would need to do so anyway in order to
abide by your organization's policy).

Demonstration version:

The demonstration version is absolutely free, but may not be repackaged
or resold to any third party. Registration lets me know about you in order
that I may advise of bugs and updates, and where to obtain the latest
copies. The demo is restricted in some ways - there is a maximum line
length on input code, a maximum input file size, but these are the only
ways in which it differs (deliberately) from the full commercial version.

Beta Test version:

Thank you for agreeing to beta test PRECCX. I want to hold on to my rights,
so I am making you sign the license agreement. You thereby agree not to
redistribute, repackage or sell your copy of PRECCX to any third party.
It is, of course, absolutely free to you, and I look forward to receiving
your complaints.

Full version:

The cost of registering one copy of PRECCX under a maintenance agreement
is $29.95.  Registration entitles you to a version of the program
that has no limitations and explicitly gives you full rights to use the
program in order to produce your own software for distribution to other
parties, even if it contains sections of PRECCX code.  You will also
receive written notification of future releases and guaranteed software
support and applications advice.  I undertake to provide the fullest
maintenance service that it is reasonable to expect.  I will respond as
quickly as possible to written, emailed or telephoned enquiries about
the proper functioning or application of the software, and I will fix
bugs that are reported within a reasonable time or advise on
workarounds.  For $15.00 more, you receive the above benefits plus the
latest version of PRECCX or the next release, whichever is applicable,
via postage paid first class mail.  (Site licenses are also available,
write for info and include expected usage.) Please make checks payable
to Peter Breuer, and send to the address listed below.

Thank you for your interest.
